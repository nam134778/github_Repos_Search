# github_Repos_Search
An simple React App to search and sort repositories of a user or an organization on Github

About the criteria: Most popular - with popularity based on stars, watchers, and forks --> I refer to the newspaper: Scoring Popularity in GitHub of Abduljaleel Al-Rubaye and Gita Sukthankar. Because I don't have enough data, so I compare the sum of median of forks and median of stars of each repository to ranking it.

About the criteria: Most popular original work (unforked repositories) --> I use Star to rate for the original work.

Next, my deployed app: https://githubrepossearch.netlify.app

And finally, if you want to render my react app: you need to : npm install react-icons

Thank you for reading.
